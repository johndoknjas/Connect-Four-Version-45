You can play Connect Four against this engine.

For positions at and below 9 ply, the engine may communicate with a DB (via SQLite) to evaluate them and find a good move.
This DB was generated by a previous version of the engine (V.41) that thought on each reachable 9 ply position,
and then these results were used to generate data for all 0 to 8 ply positions as well.

The file was too large to upload to Github, but it can be downloaded here:

After downloading, copy this DB file into the main folder of the project (Version 45/), and also copy it into /bin/Debug.

After doing this, there are a few ways to run the application:
  - Go to /bin/Debug, and then run "Version 1 - April 25, 2018.exe" (the name of the exe hasn't changed since the first version).
  - Or, go inside main.cpp, and set the global bool "talk_with_python" to true. Compile the new project, and then
    open and run the "interface.py" file in /bin/Debug. This will allow you to use a Python interface, which will
    call the .exe program in the background.
       - Currently the Python user interface is as fairly plain, but I'm planning to add a GUI in a future version.
